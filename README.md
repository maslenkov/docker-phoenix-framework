# Image Contents

This image is based on the [official Elixir image](https://hub.docker.com/_/elixir/) and includes the features of that image.

At the time of writing, this Dockerfile results in an image that also contains:

* NodeJS 7.10.0 (installed via [NodeSource](https://deb.nodesource.com/node_7.x)'s APT repository)
* npm 4.2.0
* yarn 0.24.5

It also includes the following `ONBUILD` steps for convenience of use as a base image itself:

* Creates a working directory for your app at `/usr/src/app`
* Adds files like `package.json`, `yarn.lock` and `brunch-config.js` and installs `npm` dependencies through `yarn`
* Sets `MIX_ENV` to `prod`
* Copies files needed to determine Mix config and dependencies, then downloads and compiles those dependencies

All of the above occur before any custom instructions in a child Dockerfile that uses `FROM` to inherit from this one.

## Image Versions

The `latest` tag on Docker Hub should always be reasonably in sync with the tip of `master` within this repository via automated builds. Starting with `1.2.4`, git tags will also result in a corresponding Docker Hub tag.

## Checking Versions

Want to check the current versions included in the latest image in light of future rebuilds?

* `docker run -it --rm timka/phoenix-framework node -v`
* `docker run -it --rm timka/phoenix-framework npm -v`
* `docker run -it --rm timka/phoenix-framework yarn --version`
* `docker run -it --rm timka/phoenix-framework mix hex.info`

# Caveats

* `MIX_ENV` is set to `prod` globally for all commands run in the Docker container, unless overridden on a per-command basis or a later `ENV` Dockerfile instruction
* When building your own apps based on a third party's Docker image, you should make note of any `ONBUILD` instructions in the base image's `Dockerfile`, as these are executed dynamically while building your app, prior to **ANY** of the instructions in your own `Dockerfile`.
